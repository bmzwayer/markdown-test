**Bash Command Cheat Sheet**  

*Syntax* | *Command* | *Meaning*  
------ | ------- | -------  
pwd | print working directory | shows current position  
ls | list | shows items in directory  
cd | change directory | relocates into different folder  
rm | remove | deletes file or folder  
mv | move | relocates file or folder  
cp | copy | replicates file or folder  

**Things to Remember:**  
* -R means recursive and it selects all elements within that directory (for cp and rm)
* You _must_ include a -m "message" when using git commit
* Use ls -a to see hidden files/programs in a directory
